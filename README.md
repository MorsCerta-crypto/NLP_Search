# NLP_Search
 
This project uses a NGram model as well as word embeddings to search for the most relevant documents to a given query. The project is implemented in Python 3.6.5. It uses spacy to parse texts and stores the parsed texts in a sqlite database. The NGram model is implemented using a trie data structure. The word embeddings are implemented using a skip-gram model. The project also uses a simple web interface to allow users to search for documents. The web interface is implemented using Flask.
